Fraud detection and investigation presents one of the most popular use
cases for graph databases, at least in the financial services
industry...or any industry folks are incentivized to masque or hide
certain nefarious behavior. But for those not employed directly by a
bank or insurance firm, it can be hard to study or experiment with
realistic data.

Turns out /a lack of publicly available datasets is a real problem for
academics/ looking to test machine learning or heuristic approaches to
fraud.

*PaySim* looks to change that, at least for mobile money network
providers.

/Lopez-Rojas, Elmire, and Axelsson/[fn:1] published a solution to take
an agent-based model, some anonymized aggregate transactional data
from a real mobile money network operator, and create a means of
generating "similar" totally anonymous data programatically.

* About this PaySim Series
This is the first post of a few (2 to 3?) that will explore my
experimentation and research into taking the open-source PaySim
project, improving upon it, and integrating it with Neo4j to implement
a fraud analytics platform.

In this first post I'll cover:
- Some details on Mobile Money Networks
- PaySim and how I've improved it
- Initial planning of the PaySim transaction network graph
- Adding 1st and 3rd Party Fraudsters to PaySim

* Background: A Mobile Money Primer
Mobile money takes different forms, but in the case of PaySim it
involves both Banks and participating Merchants. If I understand
correctly, Merchants can take mobile payments via the network (for
goods/services) as well as perform the function of putting money into
the network (e.g. "topping up" an account).

The mobile money network used by the PaySim authors comes from an
undisclosed African country, which leads me to believe it's of the
sort similar to M-Pesa: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa

From the above Wikipedia page:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
M-Pesa is a branchless banking service; M-Pesa customers can deposit
and withdraw money from a network of agents that includes airtime
resellers and retail outlets acting as banking agents.
#+END_QUOTE

* An Overview of PaySim
So what exactly is PaySim? What is it modeling?

Let's jump a bit ahead and talk about what PaySim looks like with the
help of some graph visualizations and then dive into the core
components: Actors and Transactions.

#+CAPTION: Graphical representation of the PaySim data model
#+NAME: fig:initial-data-model
[[/img/simplified-data-model.png]]

In words, using some Neo4j/Cypher terminology:

- *Clients* =:PERFORM= /zero or many/ Transactions where credits or
  debits apply from their balance =:TO= another agent's balance.

- *Transactions* occur ordered in time for each Client performing
  them, where each *Transaction* may be the =:FIRST_TX= or =:LAST_TX=
  performed by a *Client*.

- When *Clients* perform /two or more/ Transactions, since they
  happen sequentially, you can order them by time in a sequence where
  all but the =:LAST_TX= has a =:NEXT= Transaction in the chain.

** About Agent Types
Agents are the key actors in the simulation and take one of a variety
of forms:

- *Clients* are end users in the money network, mapping effectively to
  someone or someone's phone, credit card, etc. and come in different types:
  + Some clients are *Fraudsters* and manipulate the network,
  + Some clients act solely as *Mules*,
  + But most are regular accounts, behaving normally!

- *Merchants* are businesses that conduct transactions with *Clients*
  + In a mobile money network, *Merchants* also act as a gateway to
    get assets into and out of the network.
  + But they can also provide goods/services in exchange for money in
    the network.

- *Banks* are...banks! (Pretty simple.)

** Transaction Types
Clients are the sole agents that can perform Transactions. There are
five (5) primary types of transactions a Client can perform and each
must follow certain rules:

- Each *Transaction* requires a second agent of a particular type
  dependent on the type of Transaction

- Only *Transfers* between Clients require proper double-entry
  bookkeeping where there's a zero-sum, meaning Banks and Merchants
  are ingress/egress points.

- *Transfers* can occur up to some global transfer limit set in the
  simulation parameters.

#+CAPTION: Table of Transaction Types
| Transaction | Description                                            |
|-------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| CashIn      | A Client moves money into the network via a Merchant   |
| CashOut     | A Client moves money out of the network via a Merchant |
| Debit       | A Client moves money into a Bank                       |
| Transfer    | A Client sends money to another Client                 |
| Payment     | A Client exchanges money for something from a Merchant |

* Making PaySim Play Nice
PaySim is provided as a Java application built upon the MASON agent
simulation framework[fn:2]. It's got a few shortcomings we need to
overcome before we can easily build a demo that will generate our graph:

1. It expects to write out simulation results as CSV files. While
   Neo4j natively supports loading csv[fn:3], loading the transactions
   on the fly would open a lot more demo possibilities like simulating
   real-time detection and action.

2. Transactions in the original PaySim contain some bare bones data,
   with some critical aspects left to be inferred.

3. The original PaySim never explicitly documents all the actors in a
   simulation run, leaving you to infer their details from the raw
   transaction output.

What do we do in open-source when we want things improved? No, it's
not open a dozen issues in Github...it's called fork it and do it
yourself! As such, PaySim is provided under the GPLv3 and my fork is available
at https://github.com/voutilad/PaySim.

Now let's talk about addressing the embeddability issues.

** Making PaySim more of a Library than an App
First up is fixing PaySim's desire to only output to the file
system. There are two primary improvements I made to make PaySim
embeddable as a library:

- Abstracted out the base simulation logic from the orchestration, so
  the original PaySim can be run writing out to disk, but developers
  can implement alternative implementations doing whatever they want.

- Implemented an iterating version of PaySim, allowing an application
  embedding PaySim to drive the simulation at its own pace and consume
  data on the fly.

The original PaySim logic is preserved, but the front-end is now
choosable by the developer or end-user. For example, to run something
analagous to the original PaySim project, you can run the =main()=
method in the =OriginalPaySim= class and it will write out all the
expected output files to disk.

#+CAPTION: IteratingPaySim Implementation (high-level)
#+NAME: fig:iteratingpaysim
[[/img/IteratingPaySim.svg]]

If instead you want to drive the simulation using an implementation of
a Java =Iterator<org.paysim.base.Transaction>=, use the
=IteratingPaySim= class and consume transactions sequentially. A
worker thread drives the simulation in the background while data flows
via an buffered implementation of a =java.util.ArrayDeque=[fn:6]. (The
nitty gritty details are beyond the scope of this post at the moment.)

** Improving PaySim Transactions & History
This part is a relatively simple change as to keep compatibility with
the original PaySim logic I've kept the =Transaction= implementation
relatively the same, with the key exception of adding in details about
the actor "types" on the sending and receiving end.

Since all actors derive from the =org.paysim.actors.SuperActor= base
class, they all implement some /getter/ for a =SuperActor.Type=
value (an enum).

By tracking the =SuperActor.Type= on the =Transaction=:

1. We don't have to keep references to the actors and they can
   ultimately be garbage collected by the JVM if we destroy the
   simulation.

2. More importantly, we can always know what type of actors the
   transaction pertains to, allowing us to accurately look up specific
   instances either in PaySim's tracking of Clients/Merchants/Banks or
   in our resulting database.

** Other Miscelanneous Housekeeping
I made various touchups and tweaks that are too in-the-weeds for this
blog post when overhauling the core of PaySim, so if you're interested
make sure to check out the project's [[https://github.com/voutilad/PaySim#why-fork][README]] for some more details.


* Going beyond PaySim 2.0
If we relax our view of PaySim a little, i.e. take the mobile money
network approach and let it instead model just any transaction based
financial network, can we expand to include different types of fraud?

** The Original PaySim Fraudster Behavior
PaySim as-is only models what looks to be a form of 3rd-party fraud:

1. Fraudsters target an established Client account (the victim)
2. Fraudsters trigger Transfers from that victim to a Mule account the
   Fraudster creates
3. When the Mule has a certain balance level it performs a "CashOut"

A manifestation of this might be someone breaching someone's mobile
money account via credential skimming/theft or phishing. Once the
Fraudster has access to the payment card they can cash out by buying
instruments like gift cards or prepaid cards that can in turn either
be used or sold to convert to actual cash.

It's got some basis in the real-world, but can we make it a tad more
realistic? Where could we improve?

- Fraudsters try to completely drain a Victim's account, performing
  Transfers up to the network "transfer limit" set by the model
  parameters. In real world credit card fraud, cards are usually
  "tested" through small transactions or pre-authorization before
  being used for big purchases.
- A PaySim Fraudster picks a Victim from the simulation universe at
  random. In the real world, while there's some behavior that may
  appear random, usually Fraudsters breach or compromise a Merchant's
  POS systems (both offline and online) to initially gain access to
  Victim accounts.

Lastly, the above is all about 3rd-party fraud: what about 1st-party?
Typically 1st-party involves some level of credit building, and our
mobile money network isn't exactly a credit network. Still, we can
pretend!

** Improving 3rd Party Fraudsters
We'll enhance our 3rd-party Fraudsters to incorporate a few new
behaviors:

- Support storing "favored" Merchants that the Fraudster will use as a
  means of targeting Clients for victimization
- Keep track of Victims
- For new Victims, try making "test charges" simulating real world
  card testing

Like the original PaySim, we'll keep the idea that a 3rd-party
Fraudster creates a Mule account.

For logic changes, let's keep it simple but accounting for some key
events:

1. Test fraud probability like in original PaySim. If test fails,
   abort actions for this simulation step.

2. If there are no victims /OR/ we pass a probability check for
   picking a new victim (=P_NEW_VICTIM=), we enter New Victim mode:
   * Pick a Merchant at random from favored merchants.
   * Pick a Client via the Merchant history at random /OR/ if there is
     no favorted Merchant, pick a random Client from the universe.
   * Conduct "Payment" transcations acting as test charges
   * If the test charge succeeds (i.e. Victim has non-zero balance),
     then try performing a "Transfer" of some percentage of the Client
     balance to a Mule.

3. Otherwise, pick an existing Victim at random and try a "Transfer"
   of some percentage of the Client balance to a Mule.

See the [[https://github.com/voutilad/PaySim/blob/master/src/main/java/org/paysim/actors/ThirdPartyFraudster.java][ThirdPartyFraudster]] class in the code base for implementation
details.

** 1st Party Fraudsters
First Party Fraud typically entails using partially or completely fake
identities in order to establish some form of credit with no intent to
fulfill any debts. (See the definition in [[https://www.openriskmanual.org/wiki/First_Party_Fraud][Open Risk Manual]].) But,
PaySim doesn't have any form of identities!

If we bend our definition of the payment network being modeled by
PaySim, adding identities is pretty easy, but requires a bit of an
overhaul across the actor codebase. We ultimately needs all Clients,
whether Fraudsters, Mules, or regular, to have some identifiable
details that are generally unique.

*** Modeling Identities
From a graph perspective, there's a pretty trivial way to incorporate
identities with Clients: relate each Client to an instance of an
Identity.

**INSERT IMAGE**

From the PaySim code perspective, it gets a bit trickier, and easily
can turn into a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality][bike shedding]] exercise. Here's where I ended up:

- All =SuperActor= instances (our base actor class) are
  =Identifiable=.
  + Being =Identifiable= means you have an "Id" and a "Name" (both
    Strings) as attributes.
  + It also means you can provide a reference to an =Identity=.

- An =Identity= effectively is a container for the different identity
  attributes (name, id, etc.) and there are multiple implementations:
  + A =BankIdentity= and =MerchantIdentity= both only have an "Id" and
    a "Name".
  + A =ClientIdentity= is more representitive of a "person", having
    not only a "Name" and "Id", but others like "email", "ssn", and
    "phone" numbers.

- An =IdentityFactory= provides a deterministic means of producing
  "random" identities as needed.
  + It effectively abstracts a 3rd party library ([[https://github.com/Devskiller/jfairy][jFairy]]) I'm
    currently using to generate "realistic" people and companies.
  + While jFair uses a different random number generator than the core
    of PaySim, it can take a seed and produce deterministic results,
    which is key to keeping PaySim reproducable.

- Finally, constructors for actors get overhauled to optionally take a
  reference to an =Identity= implementation /OR/ will generate one if
  not provided.

/PHEW!/ If you want to look at the code mess, the [[https://github.com/voutilad/PaySim/blob/master/src/main/java/org/paysim/identity/][org.paysim.identity]]
package contains most of the additional code. Also check out some
commits like [[https://github.com/voutilad/PaySim/commit/78b1cfba74d3291bdcc90dfc332b2b28a2abc3f4][78b1cfb]] and [[https://github.com/voutilad/PaySim/commit/f7b174a698d7fdd3f49b61255944975b05339146][f7b174a]] to see how things were changed.

*** Building the 1st Party Fraudster
Now that we have an identity component to our actors, let's put
together a new fraudster.

Using security breaches and identity theft stories from the headlines,
let's pretend our fraudster acquired some number of viable identities
(names, ssn's, and phone numbers). When we create a 1st-party
fraudster, we can generate a handful of identities and give them to
the fraudster.

For committing the fraud, we'll start with a pretty trivial
implementation:

1. Do a fraud probability check to see if we continue or skip running
   during this simulation step.
2. Generate a "new" identity, composing parts from our "stolen"
   identities.
3. Create the new client account using the identity.
4. Drain whatever starting balance was given to the new account,
   transferring its balance to the fraudster's designated Mule.
5. Profit.

From an Java implementation standpoint[fn:4], it's pretty short and sweet:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
  @Override
  public void step(SimState state) {
      PaySimState paysim = (PaySimState) state;
      final int step = (int) state.schedule.getSteps();

      if (paysim.getRNG().nextDouble() < parameters.fraudProbability) {
          ClientIdentity fauxIdentity = composeNewIdentity(paysim);
          Mule m = new Mule(paysim, fauxIdentity);

          Transaction drain = m.handleTransfer(cashoutMule, step, m.balance);
          fauxAccounts.add(m);
          paysim.addClient(m);
          paysim.onTransactions(Arrays.asList(drain));
      }
  }
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_aside
You'll probably notice the use of a =Mule= instead of =Client=. This
is because a =Mule= effectively is a "brain dead" =Client= that
doesn't try to perform regular transactions each step. This prevents
the fraudulent account from running amock.
#+END_aside

* In Summary
We've now got a quite different data model than we originally had just
using the vanilla PaySim project.

#+CAPTION: Our Updated PaySim 2.1 Data Model
#+NAME: fig:updated-data-model
[[/img/paysim-2.1.0.png]]

It now:
- provides identifiers (e.g. =Phone=) for each Client account
- incorporates both 1st and 3rd Party fraud logic (not visible in the
  model)

* Next Time: Getting PaySim Transactions into Neo4j
At this point, we've got a revamped, new version of PaySim that can be
run standalone or embedded. We've also got an understanding of our
data model and how we plan on adapting it to our graph model, laying
the foundation.

In my next post, we'll look at how to drive the PaySim implementation
while bulk loading the transaction output into a Neo4j instance. It'll
cover:

- Leveraging the Neo4j Java Driver[fn:5] to load PaySim Transactions
  on the fly as the simulation runs
- Best practices in batch/bulk data loading to get high throughput
- Threading transactions into event chains and why that's helpful for
  downline analysis.

A final post (TBD) will dive into how to analyze the data from both a
visual perspective as well as an algorithmic approach.

Note: If viewing this org file in a site like Github, footnotes
probably don't rendor properly. Just a heads up!
