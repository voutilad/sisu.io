If you've followed along in the PaySim series of posts or at least
discovered [[https://github.com/voutilad/paysim-demo][the demo project]], you've now got a graph representing 30
days of financial transactions in a simulated financial network.

Somewhere in that haystack are our [[file:paysim.org::Enhancing PaySim's Fraudsters][fraudsters]] we created previously,
or at least the result of their malicious behavior.

The question is: *How can we leverage the fact we've built a graph
to rapidly identify potential first party fraudsters?*

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Looking for previous posts? See [[file:paysim.org][part 1]] to learn about PaySim and
[[file:paysim-part2.org][part 2]] to learn about integrating it with Neo4j.

For instructions on installing Neo4j's Graph Data Science library, see
the documentation [[https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/1.0/installation/][here]].
#+END_QUOTE

* What's our Graph look like again?
Before we dig into our methodology and look at some queries, let's
first recap and look at the graph we built and loaded in [[file:paysim-part2.org][Part 2]].

#+CAPTION: Remember our PaySim data model!
#+fig: paysim-schema
file:../static/img/paysim-2.1.0.png

Now that's just the schema of our graph, but what are defining
characteristics of our data? We can use a mix of Cypher and helper
procedures from [[https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/][APOC]] to profile our graph.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
CALL db.labels() YIELD label
CALL apoc.cypher.run('MATCH (:`'+label+'`) RETURN count(*) as freq',{}) YIELD value
WITH label,value.freq AS freq
CALL apoc.meta.stats() YIELD nodeCount
WITH *, 10^3 AS scaleFactor, toFloat(freq)/toFloat(nodeCount) AS relFreq
RETURN label AS nodeLabel,
    freq AS frequency,
    round(relFreq*scaleFactor)/scaleFactor AS relativeFrequency
ORDER BY freq DESC
#+END_SRC

The above Cypher will:
- interrogate the database to get all known labels (e.g. /Client/,
  /Transaction/, etc.)
- Run a sub-query using APOC to get label counts
- Analyze the label counts against the global label counts

#+CAPTION: Relative Frequency of Labels in our PaySim Graph
#+NAME: fig:paysim-frequency
[[file:../static/img/paysim-node_freq.png]]

So most (62%) of our transaction activity is some form of
ingress/egress where money flows into and out of the network via
=CashIn=/=CashOut= transactions. The remaining 38% of activity
involves money flowing to and from parties in the network.

/Is there anything interesting about the transactions themselves?/

Let's take a look.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Get the total number of transactions in count, value, and frequency
MATCH (t:Transaction)
WITH sum(t.amount) AS globalSum, count(t) AS globalCnt
WITH *, 10^3 AS scaleFactor
UNWIND ['CashIn', 'CashOut', 'Payment', 'Debit', 'Transfer'] AS txType
    CALL apoc.cypher.run('MATCH (t:' + txType + ') RETURN sum(t.amount) as txAmount, count(t) AS txCnt', {}) YIELD value
    RETURN txType,
    	value.txAmount AS TotalMarketValue,
        100 * round(scaleFactor * (toFloat(value.txAmount) / toFloat(globalSum)))/scaleFactor AS `%MarketValue`,
        100 * round(scaleFactor * (toFloat(value.txCnt) / toFloat(globalCnt)))/scaleFactor AS `%MarketTransactions`,
        toInteger(toFloat(value.txAmount) / toFloat(value.txCnt)) AS AvgTransactionValue,
        value.txCnt AS NumberOfTransactions
    ORDER BY `%MarketTransactions` DESC
#+END_SRC

The above Cypher performs a pretty basic aggregation of the number of
transactions by type, the total monetary value, and the average value
of each transaction.

#+CAPTION: Aggregate Transaction statistical profile
#+NAME: fig:transaction-stats
[[file:../static/img/paysim-transaction_freq.png]]

The =CashIn= transactions still dominate in terms of quantity and
average transaction size, but interestingly =Transfer= transactions
make up over a 1/3rd of the total market activity in terms the amount
of money involved even though they're hardly 6% of the total
transaction volume. In fact, the average =Transfer= involves funds
/6.25 times/ the average =CashIn= transaction!!

What does this mean? 🧐

*Money is passed around in large quantities more
than its injected into or removed from the network.*[fn:1]

Given that fact, we'll probably see something interesting when we look
at transfers of money between Clients!

* Finding our First Party Fraud
Recall that First Party Fraud is a form of identity fraud where the
fraudster either uses either fully synthetic (fake) identifiers or
steals and uses real identifiers in order to build up some account
standing (e.g. credit rating or credit line) before "busting out" and
draining the account into something liquid they can run away with.

In our PaySim version, we've constructed 1st Party Fraudsters that
generate pools of identifiers like *Emails*, *SSNs*, and *Phone
Numbers* that they remix into different (ideally unique) combinations
when creating a client in our network. Then at some time in the
future, they drain those accounts via an intermediary (a *mule*) and
conduct a =CashOut= to exflitrate the money from our network.

Our methodology for finding these fraudulent accounts will be as
follows:

1. Cull the universe down to potentially fruadulent accounts using
   community detect methods.
2. Quantify and filter community members based on similarity.
3. Identify hot spots (possible initial sources of fraud) using
   centralitiy measurements.
4. Visualize the subgraph to illustrate the impact and any anomalies.

** Filtering the Universe with Weakly Connected Components
Our first step leverages the connectedness of our graph and looks for
PaySim Clients that share identifiers. Since when we loaded our data
in [[file:paysim-part2.org][part 2]] creating unique nodes for each instance of an identifier
(e.g. there's only one SSN of 123-45-6789), it's almost trivial to
find Clients that share identifiers.

The [[https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/1.0/algorithms/wcc/][Weakly Connected Components]] algorithm analyzes the graph and
identifies "graph components". A [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)][component]] is a set of nodes and
relationships where you can reach each member (node) from any other
through traversal. It's called "weakly" since we don't account for the
directionality of relationships.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Connected component algorithms are a type of community detection
algorithm. They're great for understanding the structure of a
graph.
#+END_QUOTE

#+CAPTION: "A graph with three components" by David Eppstein (Public Domain, Wikipedia, 2007)
#+NAME: fig:three-components
[[file:../static/img/3rdparty/Pseudoforest.svg]]

The net result: the algorithm identifies all the possible subgraphs of
Clients that have some identifiers in common.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Sounds almost too easy, right? In practice, it's not uncommon for
identifiers to be shared among accounts. A simple example is a shared
mailing address for roommates or family members. In real world fraud
detection methologies, identifiers tend to be weighted differently.
#+END_QUOTE

*** Create our WCC Projection
Since we don't care about all nodes and relationships for our WCC
approach, we can keep our algorithm focused on just a subgraph and
load it into memory.[fn:2]

Recall our data model we built out in [[file:paysim.org::Our%20Journey%20So%20Far][part 1]]:

#+CAPTION: The PaySim 2.1 Data Model
#+NAME: fig:paysim-2.1-data-model
[[file:../static/img/paysim-2.1.0.png]]

In our case, we're concerned about only 4 label types:

- *Client* which is our account/account holder
- *SSN* which is like a US social security number (or Canadian SNI,
  etc.)
- *Email* which should be an email address
- *Phone* which represents someone's contact phone number

And we only need the relationships that connect nodes of the above
labels: *HAS_SSN, HAS_EMAIL, HAS_PHONE*.

So let's target the following subgraph:

#+CAPTION: Just our Identifiers in PaySim 2.1
#+NAME: fig:paysim-identifiers
[[file:../static/img/simple-identity-model.png]]

We'll use the =gds.graph.create=[fn:3] stored procedure and lists of Labels
and Relationships of the part of the graph we want to analyze.

First, let's estimate how much memory our projection will consume.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
CALL gds.graph.create.estimate(
    ['Client', 'SSN', 'Email', 'Phone'],
    ['HAS_SSN', 'HAS_EMAIL', 'HAS_PHONE'])
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Our estimate for our Graph Projection
#+NAME: fig:paysim-wcc-estimate
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-wcc-estimate.png

According to the =requiredMemory= output, it looks like we'll need
about 8-46 megabytes...pretty small! Why is that? We're focusing only
on Clients and their identifiers, which comprise only ~1-2% of our
total database in terms of nodes. (Recall we analyzed that [[What's our Graph look like again?][earlier]] in
this post.)

Ok, let's create the projection now. You'll notice the stored
procedure call is similar, but now we also give it a name we'll use to
refer to the projection later:

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Create our projection called "wccGroups"
CALL gds.graph.create('wccGroups',
    ['Client', 'SSN', 'Email', 'Phone'],
    ['HAS_SSN', 'HAS_EMAIL', 'HAS_PHONE'])
#+END_SRC

You should see some metadata output telling you some details about the
type and size of the graph projection. It'll detail how many
relationships and nodes were processed plus some other facts.

#+CAPTION: Our "wccGroups" graph projection output
#+NAME: fig:paysim-wcc-graph-projection
[[file:../static/img/paysim-part3-load-wcc.png]]

*Easy, peasy!* Let's get on with running the algorithm...

*** Compute and tag our WCC groups
With the subgraph loaded, we can simply let the algorithm do its
thing. In the interest of learning and sanity checking our work, let's
first look at the algorithm output before we go much further.

The algorithm is accessed via the =gds.wcc.stream= stored procedure
call and it provides as output the internal id of a given node
(=nodeId=) and the component it's a part of (=componentId=). We'll use
the utility function =gds.util.asNode()= to fetch the underlying Node
instance by its internal id and then analyze our groupings:

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Call the WCC algorithm using our native graph projection
CALL gds.wcc.stream('wccGroups') YIELD nodeId, componentId

// Algos return internal ids, so fetch the actual Node from the db
// and use its paysim id
WITH componentId, collect(gds.util.asNode(nodeId).id) AS clientIds

// Identify groups where there are at least 2 clients
WITH *, size(clientIds) as groupSize WHERE groupSize > 1
RETURN * ORDER BY groupSize DESC LIMIT 1000
#+END_SRC

Scanning the results, we have a few large clusters and a lot of small
clusters. Those large clusters will probably be of interest and we'll
come back to that shortly.

#+CAPTION: Our largest graph Components per WCC
#+NAME: fig:paysim-wcc-stream
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-wcc-stream.png

Now let's re-run the algorithm and tag our groups!

We'll give each matching =Client= node a new property we'll call
=fraud_group= and assign the =componentId= generated by the
algorithm. This will let us recall the groups at will via basic Cypher
against the core database.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Call the WCC algorithm using our native graph projection
CALL gds.wcc.stream('wccGroups') YIELD nodeId, componentId

// Algos return internal ids, so fetch the actual Node from the db
WITH componentId, collect(gds.util.asNode(nodeId).id) AS clientIds
WITH *, size(clientIds) AS groupSize WHERE groupSize > 1

// Note that in this case, clients is a list of paysim ids.
// Let's unwind the list, MATCH, and tag them individually.
UNWIND clientIds AS clientId
    MATCH (c:Client {id:clientId})
    SET c.fraud_group = componentId
#+END_SRC

For good measure, you should index the =fraud_group= property for
faster recall. Let's do that.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Client(fraud_group)
#+END_SRC

*** Sanity Checking WCC's Output
Lastly, let's sanity check our results. A few queries ago we only
glanced at the output, but now that we have groups tagged in our
database and the =fraud_group= property indexed, let's take a deeper
look at how the communities shake out.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// MATCH only our tagged Clients and group them by group size
MATCH (c:Client) WHERE c.fraud_group IS NOT NULL
WITH c.fraud_group AS groupId, collect(c.id) AS members
WITH groupId, size(members) AS groupSize
WITH collect(groupId) AS groupsOfSize, groupSize

RETURN groupSize,
	size(groupsOfSize) AS numOfGroups
ORDER BY groupSize DESC
#+END_SRC

What's the data look like?

#+CAPTION: Histogram of Group Size
#+NAME: fig:paysim-wcc-histogram
[[file:../static/img/paysim-part3-wcc-analysis.png]]

Ok, wow. Seems most of the communities are pretty small with only 2-3
members, but _we have some clear anomalies where 6 groups have
community sizes of 9 or more._ Something fishy has to be going on with
them!

Let's take a look at them...

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Visualize the larger likely-fraudulent groups
MATCH (c:Client) WHERE c.fraud_group IS NOT NULL
WITH c.fraud_group AS groupId, collect(c.id) AS members
WITH *, size(members) AS groupSize WHERE groupSize > 8

MATCH p=(c:Client {fraud_group:groupId})-[:HAS_SSN|HAS_EMAIL|HAS_PHONE]->()
RETURN p
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Our Fraud Groups (of size > 8)
#+NAME: fig:paysim-wcc-large-groups
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-wcc-large-groups.svg

Our six graph components contain a handful of Clients (nodes in
yellow) that appear to share identifiers like SSN, Email, and Phone
numbers (the nodes in the purplish color).

** Analyzing our Suspicious Groups
Now that we've identified Client members of some suspcious groups,
what if we look at the other Clients outside the group they've
transacted with?

Maybe we can find something about the true extent of these fraud
networks!

*** Looking at who interacts with our Fraud Groups
Let's use a simple cypher query to figure out who our fraud groups
interact with, maybe there's something we can learn.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Recall our tagged Clients and group them by group size
MATCH (c:Client) WHERE c.fraud_group IS NOT NULL
WITH c.fraud_group AS groupId, collect(c.id) AS members
WITH groupId, size(members) AS groupSize WHERE groupSize > 8

// Expand our search to Clients one Transaction away
MATCH p=(:Client {fraud_group:groupId})-[]-(:Transaction)-[]-(c:Client)
WHERE c.fraud_group IS NULL
RETURN p
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: External Transactions with our Large Fraud Groups
#+NAME: fig:paysim-wcc-large-groups-transactions
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-external-transactions.svg

Now that's something...it /looks/ like what we thought were 6 distinct
groups *might actually be less*. One in particular (at the top of the
visualization) seems to be a very expansive network with numerous
Clients involved.

Let's do some quick analysis and see what types of Transactions occur
between these Clients. With a slight tweak to the query, we can
perform some aggregate reporting:

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Recall our tagged Clients and group them by group size
MATCH (c:Client) WHERE c.fraud_group IS NOT NULL
WITH c.fraud_group AS groupId, collect(c.id) AS members
WITH groupId, size(members) AS groupSize WHERE groupSize > 8

// Build our network as before
MATCH (:Client {fraud_group:groupId})-[]-(txn:Transaction)-[]-(c:Client)
WHERE c.fraud_group IS NULL

// Since our PaySim demo stacks labels, let's look at our txn reference
UNWIND labels(txn) AS txnType
    RETURN distinct(txnType), count(txnType)
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: An Analysis of Transactions between our Fraud Groups and Others
#+NAME: fig:paysim-large-group-transactions-analysis
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-external-transactions-analysis.png

*WOW!* All the transactions that connect other Clients to our fraud
groups are *all Transfers.* Kinda fishy!

*** Connecting our new 2nd-level Fraud groups
We've now identified four potential fraud rings. Let's tag them and
relate them to one another to make further analysis easier.

We'll simplify how our suspect Clients relat to one another connecting
them via direct =TRANSACTED_WITH= relationships if they've performed a
Transaction with one another:

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Recall our tagged Clients and group them by group size
MATCH (c:Client) WHERE c.fraud_group IS NOT NULL
WITH c.fraud_group AS groupId, collect(c.id) AS members
WITH groupId, size(members) AS groupSize WHERE groupSize > 8

// Expand our search to Clients one Transaction away
MATCH (c1:Client {fraud_group:groupId})-[]-(t:Transaction)-[]-(c2:Client)
WHERE c2.fraud_group IS NULL

// Set these Clients as suspects for easier recall
SET c1.suspect = true, c2.suspect = true

// Merge a relationship directly between Clients and copy some
// of the Transaction properties over in case we need them.
MERGE (c1)-[r:TRANSACTED_WITH]->(c2)
ON CREATE SET r += t
RETURN count(r)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Note: We'll ignore trying to preserve the directionality of the
original Transaction. That's a lesson left to the reader. 😉
#+END_QUOTE

Now how do our simplified 2nd-level groups look?

#+CAPTION: Our 2nd-Level Fraud Groups
#+NAME: fig:paysim-second-level-groups
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-second-level.svg

*** WCC Redux: Quickly identify our new Groupings
We'll use the WCC algorithm again to tag members of each of the
groups, but unlike before we'll use what's called a /cypher
projection/[fn:4] to define how we'll target a subgraph.

Plus, since this is a pretty small projection (only a few hundred
nodes), we'll forego creating a named projection and just run it on
the fly! This time we'll use the =gds.wcc.write= procedure that will
run the WCC algorithm and tag our members for us, making this pretty
trivial.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You may wonder, why didn't we use this procedure before instead of the
=gds.wcc.stream= procedure? Well, last time we didn't want to deal
with components with only a single Client because they're not very
suspcicous in our case.
#+END_QUOTE

Run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// We now use Cypher to target our Nodes and Relationships for input.
// Note how for relationships, the algorithm just wants to know which
// node relates to another and doesn't actually care about the type!
CALL gds.wcc.write({
    writeProperty: 'fraud_group_2',
    nodeQuery: 'MATCH (c:Client {suspect:true}) RETURN id(c) AS id',
    relationshipQuery: 'MATCH (c1:Client {suspect:true})-[r:TRANSACTED_WITH]->(c2:Client)
                        RETURN id(c1) AS source, id(c2) as target'
})
#+END_SRC

And like before, we'll index our new property for faster retrieval:

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
CREATE INDEX ON :Client(fraud_group_2)
#+END_SRC

Now let's analyze our new groups and their memberships:

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Recall our tagged Clients and group them by group size
MATCH (c:Client) WHERE c.fraud_group_2 IS NOT NULL
WITH c.fraud_group_2 AS secondGroupId, collect(c.id) AS members

RETURN secondGroupId, size(members) AS groupSize
ORDER BY groupSize DESC
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: How large are our 2nd Level Fraud Groups?
#+NAME: fig:paysim-second-level-group-sizes
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-second-level-sizes.png

It looks like the second-level group with id =1= is /MASSIVE/ compared
to the others! Probably a high-value fraud ring we can try breaking up.

** Quantitatively Identifying Suspects
First thing we can do is use our eyeballs and our intuition. Graphs
make it easy for humans to start asking questions because we're
glorified pattern-recognition biocomputers doing it since birth using
any of our senses as input.

But how can we do this algorithmically?

*** Who are our likely Suspects?
Let's say we want to tackle that massive 140 Client potential fraud
ring. Looking at the graph visually, there appear to be 3 Client
accounts that tie the whole thing together:

#+CAPTION: Our potential Targets
#+NAME: fig:paysim-second-level-targets
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-second-level-targets.png

How can we programatically target =Thomas Gomez=, =Samuel Petty=, and
=Luke Oneal=?

*** Computing Betweenness Centrality
Another algorithm we can leverage is called [[https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/1.0/algorithms/betweenness-centrality/][Betweenness
Centrality]].[fn:5] From the documentation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Betweenness centrality is a way of detecting the amount of influence a
node has over the flow of information in a graph. It is often used to
find nodes that serve as a bridge from one part of a graph to
another.
#+END_quote

Sounds like a great fit! Let's try it out.

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Target just our largest fraud group (group 1) using a Cypher projection
CALL gds.alpha.betweenness.stream({
	nodeQuery: 'MATCH (c:Client {fraud_group_2:1}) RETURN id(c) AS id',
    relationshipQuery: 'MATCH (c1:Client)-[:TRANSACTED_WITH]-(c2:Client)
                        RETURN id(c1) AS source, id(c2) AS target'
}) YIELD nodeId, centrality

// Fetch the node and also filter out nodes with scores of 0
WITH gds.util.asNode(nodeId) AS c, centrality WHERE centrality > 0

// Return the name and order by score
RETURN c.name AS name, centrality ORDER BY centrality DESC
#+END_SRC

Let's take a look at the highest scores:

#+CAPTION: Clients of 2nd Level Fraud Group 1 sorted by Centrality
#+NAME: fig:centrality-list
file:../static/img/paysim-part3-centrality-v1.png

Hmm...not exactly who we had in mind. Can we tweak things?

*** Betweenness Centrality with a Twist
Algorithms aren't meant to be run blindly. They're a tool to be used
with purpose. Let's think for a minute about how we can adapt the
centrality score in a way to help us find our 3 suspects.

/What do all 3 have in common?/ For starters, they act as bridges
between clusters in our group. Specifically they look like bridges
with unique relationships to a single cluster member.

/What about those with the current highest centrality scores?/ They're
pretty highly connected.

💡 Idea: what if we scale the score based on the number of
connections?

#+BEGIN_SRC cypher
// Same procedure call as before
CALL gds.alpha.betweenness.stream({
	nodeQuery: 'MATCH (c:Client {fraud_group_2:1}) RETURN id(c) AS id',
    relationshipQuery: 'MATCH (c1:Client)-[:TRANSACTED_WITH]-(c2:Client)
                        RETURN id(c1) AS source, id(c2) AS target'
}) YIELD nodeId, centrality

// Filter 0 scores again
WITH gds.util.asNode(nodeId) AS c, centrality WHERE centrality > 0

// Retrieve the relationships
MATCH (c)-[r:TRANSACTED_WITH]-(:Client)

// Collect and count the number of relationships
WITH c.name AS name, centrality, collect(r) AS txns
WITH name, centrality AS original, centrality/size(txns) AS newScore

// Our score is now scaled inversely to the number of relationships
RETURN name, newScore, original ORDER BY newScore DESC
#+END_SRC

Bingo! Our targets are now in the Top 3.

* In Summary: What Did We Find?
To summarize, we used the Graph Data Science library to perform some
critical steps in our analysis of our financial transaction data:

1. We culled the universe down to potential /First Party Fraudsters/
   using /Weakly Connected Components (WCC)/.
2. We then isolated the largest groups to target our investigation.
3. We expanded our search using the power of Cypher, finding out that
   the groups we identified looked very different than they first
   appeared!
4. We re-ran WCC and retagged our suspects.
5. We algorithmically found a way to identify lynchpins in our largest
   potential fraud network using a combination of /Betweenness
   Centrality/ and some old fashioned intuition!

Our take-away: look into three particularly shady characters!

Yes, but in this case, the graph algorithms library creates an even
